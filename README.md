# PSHS-CVC DBServer API
The unofficial API for the PSHS-CVC DBServer.

This project initially started as an attempt to create a decent scraping system, and was never supposed to be a large-scale project. Eventually, however, it became a full-blown interface for accessing the PSHS-CVC DBServer, and even gained its own unreleased app in the process. However, with the migration to a CloudFlare protected domain, the API was dead in the water. Because of this, the DBServer API can no longer be used, and an actual API for the DBServer must be made internally.

As of July 28, 2020, at 2:54 AM UTC, the DBServer API project has ended.

These are the remnants of said project. Feel free to look around, or revive the project, if you see fit.
